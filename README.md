# JavaScript Exercise #3

This is an exercise in working with functions that can accept different numbers of parameters. 
There are four functions to be written, all of which have been started in the file functions.js. 

## Installation:

Fork and clone this repository and run the command "npm install" to install all dependencies.

## Exercise:

Read the comments for each function in the file functions.js and write the code required to make
each function return the appropriate value.

## Running the tests

Enter "npm test" in the console to run the tests. When all tests pass, the exercise is complete.

## My solution

If you'd like to see the solution I wrote, it's stored in the repository under the branch "solution".
